      <p>My family moved around quite a bit, but overall I spent my childhood in western Washington and teen years in central Montana.</p>

      <h3>A Performer at Heart</h3>
      <p>I had enjoyed taking ballet classes from a young child, but as a teen I also discovered a love for vocal performance and (insert *jazz hands*) musical theater!</p>
      <img src="" alt="picture of Marquesa performing">
      <p>Here are just a few of the shows I got to be a part of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The Lewis and Clark Ballet</li>
        <li>The Nutcracker: A Montana Dream (montanans are *big* on Montana themed things, and Montana artists doubly so)</li>
        <li>Peter Pan</li>
        <li>Little Women</li>
        <li>Rodger's and Hammerstein's Cinderella</li>
      </ol>

      <p>... Ok, ok-- it was Lynnwood, WA, but it still fealt big to me!</p>
